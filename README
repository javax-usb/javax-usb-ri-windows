* Requirements *
****************

Windows DDK   http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/winddk.mspx
              Note that this was created using the Windows 2000 DDK.
              The Windows XP DDK and/or Windows 2003 Server DDK may not work.
              Additionally, this code was written and tested for/on Windows 2000.

Java          Standard Edition version 1.2 or greater - Micro Edition has not been tested but may work
ANT           http://jakarta.apache.org/ant (make sure to get the optional.jar file!)

*********
* Build *
*********

The ANT tool uses XML buildfiles to create the project.  Run ant in
the toplevel directory to list all available targets.  You should use
a build environment, so ANT can use the DDK build tools to create the
native library.

****************
* Installation *
****************

Add lib/jsr80_ri_windows.jar to your CLASSPATH.
Navigate to jni/dll/ and right-click on JavaxUsb.inf, then choose "Install"

*********
* Notes *
*********

This is INCOMPLETE!  So far, the JavaxUsb.dll successfully allows javax.usb
to enumerate all connected devices.  No hotplug support is included yet.
A "service" (i.e. kernel driver) must be created to allow actual communication.
This is PRE-ALPHA and not fully functional!  Feel free to discuss this on the
mailing list, but please don't bother telling me that it doesn't work.  I know!
